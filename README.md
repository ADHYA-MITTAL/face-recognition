### How i used this methodology in my project
week 1(planning,research,design):
  In this week ,i went through various github project and youtube videos to know about the different libraries used in this project. I searched for the tutorials and worked on UI design of the project.
week 2:
 I continue working on the code and research what new i can incorporate in my project. Encountered bugs in the project which i tried to debug.
week 3: 
 completed the attendance tracking model which was recoganizing the face of different people whose images have been stored in back-end by accessing the video camera.Then it was marking the attendace of that person by recording their name and their entry time in an excel sheet named as [attendandance.csv]()
